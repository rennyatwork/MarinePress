# MarinePress
Solution is not completed.
Did not implement the algorithm to detect intersections of line segments

Solution is divided as such:

MarinePress Project:
entry point

MarinePressCL (MarinePress class library) project:
Here we find the objects that make the solution up, such as:
- Dashboard: monitors the the addition, suppression of vessels
- Vessel: vessel such as in the json provided
- Intersection: an intersection between two segments (where segment is the line between positions p1 and p2)
- Position: X and Y coordinates and a timestamp
